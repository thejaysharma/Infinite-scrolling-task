React Project Installation and Setup
This README.md file provides step-by-step instructions on how to clone and run a basic React project. Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thejaysharma/infinite-scrolling-task.git
```

## Install Dependencies
1. Change your working directory to the project folder:

```bash 
cd infinite-scrolling-task
```
2. Install project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```
## Running the Development Server
